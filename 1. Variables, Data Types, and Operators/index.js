// Checkpoint 1.5 What does [] == false evaluate to? Why does that happen? Research why
// Answer: in JavaScript, it's like checking if an empty array is kinda like "false," I guess? But here's the twist â€“ JS tries to be okay and converts both sides to a common type for the comparison. So it turns the empty array into 0 then it checks if it's equals to false so that answer is true.
